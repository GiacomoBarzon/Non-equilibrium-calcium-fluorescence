# Free calcium concentration in non-equilibrium conditions

- Discretization of the reaction-diffusion equations
- Temporal and spatial evolution of free calcium, free and bound dye concentrations
- Fluorescence estimation (and its temporal derivative)
- Comparison of the model for the calcium concentration estimation starting from fluorescence measurements
